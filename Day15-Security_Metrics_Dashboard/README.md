### Day15
# Security Matrics Dashboard

This folder contains self-generated study material designed to build a **clear and practical understanding Security Matrics Dashboard** 
in Quantum Cryptography.

This folder contains learning materials and practical implementations focusing on fundamental concepts of Security Matrics Dashboard

---

In this folder, we will learn:
- What **QBER(Quantum Bit Error rate)** error rate indicate about eavesdroppinng 
- How **entrophy** measures randomness and key quality
- How **Key rate** reflects usable secure key generation 
- How to build a **multi-plot security dashboard**
- How to perform **comparartive security analysis**
- How visualization helps detect qunatum attacks
