Each contribution should follow the repository structure:

---


### Notebook Guidelines
- Keep notebooks **well-commented**
- Clearly separate:
  - Theory
  - Simulation
  - Results
  - Security insight
- Use reproducible random seeds where applicable
- Avoid unnecessary external dependencies

---

## 🧠 Research & Academic Integrity

All contributors must:

- Properly **cite academic papers, books, or online resources**
- Avoid plagiarism (direct or indirect)
- Clearly distinguish **original work vs referenced work**
- Maintain scientific accuracy and honesty

Any violation of academic integrity will result in rejection of the contribution.

## 🔐 Security & Ethical Guidelines

This repository deals with **cryptographic and security-sensitive concepts**.

Contributors must agree that:
- Code is **for educational and research purposes only**
- No contribution should encourage misuse, exploitation, or illegal activity
- Real-world attack instructions should be **simulated, not weaponized**
- No private, confidential, or proprietary data may be included
