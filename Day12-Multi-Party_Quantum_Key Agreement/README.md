### Day12
# Multi-Party Quantum Key Agreement

This folder contains self-generated study material designed to build a **clear and practical understanding Multi-Party Quantum Key Agreement** 
in Quantum Cryptography.

This folder contains learning materials and practical implementations focusing on fundamental concepts of Multi-Party Quantum Key Agreement
---

In this folder, we will learn:
- How a **3-party Quantum circuit** is constructed
- How **Shared entanglement(GHZ State)** enables multiparty correlation
- How participants contribute to a **Consensus Key**
- How the **final key is extracted**
- How to perform **failure and attack analysis**
