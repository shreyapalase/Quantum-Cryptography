### Day6
# BB84 With Intercept Resend Attack

This folder contains self-generated study material designed to build a **clear and practical understanding BB84 Protocol with intercept resend attack** 
in Quantum Cryptography.

This folder contains learning materials and practical implementations focusing on fundamental concepts of BB84 Protocol with intercept resend attack implementation.

---

In this folder, we will learn:
- How BB84 Key Distribution works
- How Eve perform an intercept-resend attack.
- How Quantum Bit Error Rate(QBER) is calculated.
- Difference between **no eve** and **eve present** scenerios
- Why error rate increase when evesdropping occures.
