### Day3
# Quantum State as Cryptographic Symbol

This folder contains self-generated study material designed to build a **clear and practical understanding Quantum State as Cryptographic Symbol** 
in Quantum Cryptography.

This folder contains learning materials and practical implementations focusing on fundamental concepts such as Qubit as Cryptographic Symbol.

---

In this folder , we will learn :
- How classical bits are encoded into quantum state $(|0\rangle,|1\rangle,|+\rangle,|-\rangle)$
- How measurement basis affect the outcome
- How to calculate error rates caused by wrong measurement
- How to visulalize the state confusion using confusion matrix

## Folder Structure

- **day03_Qubit_As_CryptoSymbol.ipynb**  
  This Jupyter Notebook contains the **practical implementation** and demonstrations of the **Qubit as Cryptographic Symbol** discussed in the theory notes.
  It may include  numerical examples, and visualizations to build intuition and practical understanding.

- **day03_notes.md**  
  This file contains **detailed theoretical notes** with deep explanations, mathematical formulations,
  and conceptual discussions designed for structured learning and revision of orthogonal,non orthogonal state ,visalization of confusion matrix.
