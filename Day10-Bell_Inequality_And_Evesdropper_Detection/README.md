### Day10
# Bell Inequality And Evesdropper Detection

This folder contains self-generated study material designed to build a **clear and practical understanding Bell Inequality And Evesdropper Detection** 
in Quantum Cryptography.

This folder contains learning materials and practical implementations focusing on fundamental concepts of Bell Inequality And Evesdropper Detection.

---

In this folder, we will learn:
- Understand Bell Inequality and the CHSH formulation
- Implement the CHSH test using quantum measurement
- Calculate the Bell parameters(S value)
- compare classical and quantum bound
- Visualize Bell inequality violation
- Understand how bell violation helps detect an evesdropper(Eve)
