### Day14
# Side Channel Simulation

This folder contains self-generated study material designed to build a **clear and practical understanding Side Channel Simulation** 
in Quantum Cryptography.

This folder contains learning materials and practical implementations focusing on fundamental concepts of Side Channel Simulation

---

In this folder, we will learn:
- What side channnel are and why they are matter in quantum cryptography 
- How detector biase create detectable exploits pattern
- How timing leakage can reveal the key information
- How to measure key bias statistically
- How to build  a side channel detection matrix
- How visualization help identify the hidden leak
