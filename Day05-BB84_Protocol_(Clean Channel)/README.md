### Day5
# BB84 Protocol(Clean Channel)

This folder contains self-generated study material designed to build a **clear and practical understanding BB84 Protocol** 
in Quantum Cryptography.

This folder contains learning materials and practical implementations focusing on fundamental concepts of BB84 Protocol implementation.

---

In this folder, we will learn:
- How random bits are genratedin BB84
- Why random bit selection is critical for security
- How sender encoded bit using quantum bases
- How the receiver measure quantum state
- How key sifting works  and why mismatched bases are discarded 
- How to calculate **key agreement precentage**
- How BB84 achives security even before encryption begin

## Folder Structure

 **1. `day05_BB84_Protocol.ipynb`**  
  This Jupyter Notebook contains the **practical implementation** and demonstrations of the **BB84** discussed in the theory notes.
  It may include  numerical examples, and visualizations to build intuition and practical understanding.

  **2. `day05_notes.md`**  
  This file contains **Description of BB84 Protocol** with deep explanations, mathematical formulations,
  and conceptual discussions designed for structured learning and overview of BB84 Protocol.
