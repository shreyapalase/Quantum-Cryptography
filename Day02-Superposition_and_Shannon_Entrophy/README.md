In This Repository, We Will Learn

- The **principle of superposition** in quantum mechanics  
- Probability amplitudes and **measurement outcomes**
- The concept of **Shannon entropy** and its mathematical formulation
- Interpretation of entropy as a **measure of uncertainty and information**
- Entropy as a **key strength metric** in cryptography
- Why **maximum entropy** is essential for secure communication
- The role of entropy and randomness in **quantum cryptography**
- Conceptual foundations behind **quantum key distribution (QKD)**
