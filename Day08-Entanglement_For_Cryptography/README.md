### Day8
# Entanglement for cryptography

This folder contains self-generated study material designed to build a **clear and practical understanding Entanglement for cryptography** 
in Quantum Cryptography.

This folder contains learning materials and practical implementations focusing on fundamental concepts of Entanglement for cryptography.

---

In this folder, we will learn:
- Create a **Bell state**(Maximally entangled state)
- Measure corelation between entangled qubits
- Observe perfect correalation
- Visualize entanglement using a **joint probability matrix**
- understand how entanglement supports secure cryptographic protocols
