# E91 Style Entangled Key Distribution

This folder contains self-generated study material designed to build a **clear and practical understanding E91 Style Entangled Key Distribution** 
in Quantum Cryptography.

This folder contains learning materials and practical implementations focusing on fundamental concepts of E91 Style Entangled Key Distribution.

---

In this folder, we will learn:
- How to **Distributes entangled qubit pair**
- How to perform **random measurement bases** and understand their importance.
- How to **extract keys** after correcting measurement outcome. 
- How to **Analyze error** and understand the effect of evesdropping.
