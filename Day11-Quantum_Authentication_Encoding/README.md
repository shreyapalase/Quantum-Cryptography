### Day11
# Quantum Authentication Encoding

This folder contains self-generated study material designed to build a **clear and practical understanding Quantum Authentication Encoding** 
in Quantum Cryptography.

This folder contains learning materials and practical implementations focusing on fundamental concepts of Quantum Authentication Encoding
---

In this folder, we will learn:
- How to Encode Authentication bit using quantum phase
- Why phase encoding is useful for authentication 
- How a receiver verifies authenticity 
- How a tampering affects the Quantum state
- Simulation of temporary attack detection
- Estimation of false acceptance probabaility
