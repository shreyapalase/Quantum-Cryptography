### Day13
# Adaptive Basis Selection

This folder contains self-generated study material designed to build a **clear and practical understanding Adaptive Basis Selection** in Quantum Cryptography.

This folder contains learning materials and practical implementations focusing on fundamental concepts of Adaptive Basis Selection

---

In this folder, we will learn:
- Why fixed basis selection is inefficient
- How to trac past measurement error
- How to adjust basis probabilities dynamically
- Hoe adaptive stratergies imprive key rate
- Visual comparision of adaptive vs fixed basis selection
