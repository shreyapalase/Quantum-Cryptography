# ⚠️ Important Notes (Very Important)

Aersimulator is not installed directly
→ it is included inside qiskit-aer

python itself is NOT listed in requirements.txt
→ instead, document it in README:

## Prerequisites
- Python >= 3.14


# 🔍 Optional (Recommended for Quantum Visualization)

If you want Bloch spheres, circuit drawings, and state plots:

pylatexenc>=2.10

(Add only if needed.)
 

#🧪 Tested Use Case

This setup fully supports:

- BB84 & E91 protocols

- AerSimulator noise models

- Measurement & basis switching

- Bell inequality experiments

- Jupyter-based teaching notebooks
