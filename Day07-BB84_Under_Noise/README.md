### Day7
# BB84 Under Noise

This folder contains self-generated study material designed to build a **clear and practical understanding BB84 Protocol with Noise** 
in Quantum Cryptography.

This folder contains learning materials and practical implementations focusing on fundamental concepts of BB84 Protocol with intercept resend attack implementation.

---

In this folder, we will learn:
- How the **BB84 QKD protocol works**
- How to simulate BB84 using **AerSimulator**
- Hoe to **inject depolarizing noise** into quantum channel.
- How measure the **Quantum Bit Error Rate(QBER)** and **Key Survival Rate**
- How noise affect the security anf reliability of QKD
- Hoe to visualize **Noise affects the security anf key survival rate** using plots.
