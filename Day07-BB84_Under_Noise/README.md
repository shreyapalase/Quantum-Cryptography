### Day7
# BB84 Under Noise

This folder contains self-generated study material designed to build a **clear and practical understanding BB84 Protocol with Noise** 
in Quantum Cryptography.

This folder contains learning materials and practical implementations focusing on fundamental concepts of BB84 Protocol with intercept resend attack implementation.

---

In this folder, we will learn:
- How BB84 Key Distribution works
- How Eve perform an intercept-resend attack.
- How Quantum Bit Error Rate(QBER) is calculated.
- Difference between **no eve** and **eve present** scenerios
- Why error rate increase when evesdropping occures.

## Folder Structure

 **1. `day07_BB84_with_Noise.ipynb`**  
  This Jupyter Notebook contains the **practical implementation** and demonstrations of the **BB84 with Noise ** discussed in the theory notes.
  It may include  numerical examples, and visualizations to build intuition and practical understanding BB84 with depolarizing noise madel

  **2. `day07_notes.md`**  
  This file contains **Description of BB84 Protocol with noise** with deep explanations, mathematical formulations,
  and conceptual discussions designed for structured learning and overview of Intercept resend attack.
