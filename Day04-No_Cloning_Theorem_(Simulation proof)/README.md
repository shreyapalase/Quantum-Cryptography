### Day4
# No-Cloning Theorem(Simulation Proof)

This folder contains self-generated study material designed to build a **clear and practical understanding No-Cloning Theorem** 
in Quantum Cryptography.

This folder contains learning materials and practical implementations focusing on fundamental concepts of No-Cloning Theorem.

---

In this folder, we will learn:
- Why unknown quantum state cannot be perfectly cloned
- How a naive cloning attempt fails
- How to represents quantum state using vectors
- How to measure similarity using **fidelity**
- How fidelity loss demonstrate the No-Cloning Theorem

## Folder Structure

- **1. `day04_No_Cloning_Theorem.ipynb`**  
  This Jupyter Notebook contains the **practical implementation** and demonstrations of the **No-Cloning Theorem** discussed in the theory notes.
  It may include  numerical examples, and visualizations to build intuition and practical understanding.

- **2. `day04_notes.md`**  
  This file contains **No-Cloning Theorem** with deep explanations, mathematical formulations,
  and conceptual discussions designed for structured learning and revision of orthogonal,non orthogonal state ,visalization of confusion matrix.
